**Cracking the coding interview solutions - Java**

This repository contains my Java solutions to the problems presented in the book "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell. The solutions aim to provide clear, efficient, and well-documented approaches to the problems.

**About the Book**
"Cracking the Coding Interview" is a comprehensive book designed to help software engineers and developers prepare for technical interviews, especially for roles in the tech industry. The book covers a wide range of data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques commonly encountered in coding interviews.

**Solutions Structure**
The solutions for each chapter/problem can be found in separate directories. Here's the directory structure:
